# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Oliver Rindholt
A frontend developer for the most part, but a fast learning, and inspired, future full-stack dev.<br/>
I'm currently learning many subjects, but primarily React, and Next.js.<br/>

Excited to learn much more in the future!

Feel free to check out my work here on my Github, at my [Personal Portfolio](https://www.oliverrindholt.dk/) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oliver-rindholt-55707b217/).
